## Introduction

The OCR Based Weight Measurement System leverages the Easy OCR library to recognize and extract text from images. It also employs color segmentation to isolate the weight display region in the image, enhancing the accuracy of the OCR process. This system is particularly useful for automating the process of reading weights from digital scales in various applications.

## Features

- **Easy OCR Integration**: Utilizes the Easy OCR library for text recognition.
- **Color Segmentation**: Applies color segmentation techniques to accurately identify the weight display region.
- **Image Processing**: Performs preprocessing on images to improve OCR accuracy.
- **User-Friendly**: Simple and easy-to-use interface for extracting weight information from images.

## Usage

To use the OCR Based Weight Measurement System, follow these steps:

1. Place the images of the weighing scales in the `images` directory.

2. Run the main script to process the images and extract weight information:
   ```bash
   python main.py
